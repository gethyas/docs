Customize your code editor to improve the Hyas developer experience and unlock new features.

## VS Code

[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a popular code editor for web developers, built by Microsoft. The VS Code engine also powers popular in-browser code editors like [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) and [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/).

Hyas works with any code editor. However, VS Code is our recommended editor for Hyas projects together with the [Hugo Language and Syntax Support](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=budparr.language-hugo-vscode) extension.

## In-Browser Editors

In addition to local editors, Hyas also runs well on in-browser hosted editors, including:

- [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/)
- [GitHub.dev](https://github.dev/)
- [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/)

:::note
[StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/) does not support [running the postinstall script](https://developer.stackblitz.com/platform/webcontainers/turbo-package-manager#install-scripts) that makes Hugo locally available.
