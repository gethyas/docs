Your new Hyas project generated from the `create hyas` CLI wizard already includes some files and folders. Others, you will create yourself and add to Hyas' existing file structure.

Here's how an Hyas project is organized, and some files you will find in your new project.

## Directories and Files

Hyas leverages an opiniated, Hugo-based folder layout for your project. Every Hyas project root should include the following directories and files:

- `assets` - Your project assets (scripts, styles, images, etc.)
- `config` - Configuration files (Hyas, Hugo, PostCSS, etc.)
- `content` - Your project content (pages, posts, etc.)
- `layouts` - Your project layouts (partials, shortcodes, etc.)
- `static` - Your non-code, unprocessed assets (fonts, icons, etc.)
- `package.json` - A project manifest.

## Example Project Tree

A common Hyas project directory might look like this:

<FileTree>

- assets/scss
  - app.scss
- config
  - _default
    - hugo.toml
    - module.toml
    - params.toml
  - postcss.config.js
- content
  - _index.md
- layouts/
- static
  - robots.txt
- package.json

</FileTree>


### `assets/scss`

It is a common convention to store your CSS or Sass files in a `assets/scss` directory, but this is not required. As long as your styles live somewhere in the `assets/` directory and are imported correctly, Hyas will handle and optimize them.
