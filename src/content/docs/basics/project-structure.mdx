Your new Hyas project generated from the `create hyas` CLI wizard already includes some files and folders. Others, you will create yourself and add to Hyas' existing file structure.

Here's how a Hyas project is organized, and some files you will find in your new project.

## Directories and Files

Hyas leverages the Hugo [directory structure](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/directory-structure/) for your project. Every Hyas project root should include the following directories and files:

- `assets` - Your project assets (scripts, styles, images, etc.)
- `config` - Your project's configuration files (Hyas, Hugo, PostCSS, etc.)
- `content` - Your project content (pages, posts, etc.)
- `layouts` - Your project layouts (partials, shortcodes, etc.)
- `static` - Your non-code, unprocessed assets (fonts, icons, etc.)
- `package.json` - A project manifest.

## Example Project Tree

A common Hyas project directory might look like this:

<FileTree>

- assets/scss
  - common
    - _custom.scss
    - _variables-custom.scss
  - app.scss
- config
  - _default
    - hugo.toml
    - module.toml
    - params.toml
- content
  - _index.md
- layouts
  - index.html
- static
  - favicon.svg
- package.json

</FileTree>


### `assets/scss`

It is a common convention to store your CSS or Sass files in a `assets/scss` directory, but this is not required. As long as your styles live somewhere in the `assets/` directory and are imported correctly, Hyas will handle and optimize them.

The `app.scss` file is used to specify the CSS or Sass files to import (or use). Put your custom (S)CSS variables in `common/variables-custom` and custom (S)CSS code in `common/_custom.scss`.

### `config/_default/`

The `hugo.toml` file includes [Hugo configuration](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/configuration/) options for your Hyas project. Here you can specify taxonomies to use, build options, server options, and more.

The `module.toml` file specifies the [Hugo mounts](https://gohugo.io/hugo-modules/configuration/#module-configuration-mounts), logically linking `node_modules` directories to component folders (ex: `assets`, `layouts`) â€” making Hyas Integrations available in your Hyas project.

The `params.toml` file is where you set Hyas configuration options like e.g. options for themes and integrations. 

See the [Configuration](/basics/configuration/) guide for details on setting configurations.

### `content/`

The `content/` directory is where you store [pages](/basics/pages/), organized in sections or page bundles (leaf bundles or branch bundles) and can contain page resources.

### `layouts/`

[Layouts](/basics/layouts/) are Hyas templates that define the UI structure shared by one or more pages.

### `static/`

The `static/` directory is for files and assets that do not need to be processed during Hyas' build process. These files will be copied into the build folder untouched.

This behavior makes `static/` ideal for common assets like images and fonts, or special files such as `robots.txt` and `manifest.webmanifest`.

You can place CSS and JavaScript in your `static/` directory, but be aware that those files will not be bundled or optimized in your final build.

:::tip
As a general rule, any CSS or JavaScript that you write yourself should live in your `assets/` directory.

### `package.json`

This is a file used by JavaScript package managers to manage your dependencies. It also defines the scripts that are commonly used to run Hyas (ex: `npm run dev`, `npm run build`).

There are [two kinds of dependencies](https://docs.npmjs.com/specifying-dependencies-and-devdependencies-in-a-package-json-file) you can specify in a `package.json`: `dependencies` and `devDependencies`. In most cases, these work the same: Hyas needs all dependencies at build time, and your package manager will install both. We recommend putting all of your dependencies in `dependencies` to start, and only use `devDependencies` if you find a specific need to do so.
