Ready to install Hyas? Follow this guide to using the `create hyas` CLI to get started.

:::note[Prefer to install Hyas manually?]
Read our [step-by-step manual installation guide](/install/manual/) instead.
:::

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** - `v16.17.0` or higher.
- **Text editor** - We recommend [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Hugo Language and Syntax Support](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=budparr.language-hugo-vscode) extension.
- **Terminal** - Hyas is accessed through its command-line interface (CLI).

## Installation

`create-hyas` is the fastest way to start a new Hyas project from scratch. It will walk you through every step of setting up your new Hyas project. It allows you to choose from a few different official starter templates. Next to that, you can also [use any existing project on GitHub with the `degit` command](http://localhost:4321/install/auto/#community).

:::tip[Online previews]
Prefer to try Hyas in your browser? Visit [new.gethyas.com](https://new.gethyas.com/) to browse our starter templates and spin up a new Hyas project without ever leaving your browser.
:::

### 1. Run the Setup Wizard

Run the following command in your terminal to start our handy install wizard:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="npm">
```bash
npm create hyas@latest
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="pnpm">
```bash
pnpm create hyas@latest
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Yarn">
```bash
yarn create hyas
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

You can run `create-hyas` anywhere on your machine, so thereâ€™s no need to create a new empty directory for your project before you begin. If you donâ€™t have an empty directory yet for your new project, the wizard will help create one for you automatically.

If all goes well, you should see a "Done" message followed by some "Next steps".

### 2. Install dependencies

`cd` into your new project directory and install your dependencies before continuing.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="npm">
```bash
npm install
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="pnpm">
```bash
pnpm install
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Yarn">
```bash
yarn install
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### 3. Start Hyas âœ¨

Hyas uses the Hugo development server that has everything you need for project development. The `dev` command will start the local development server so that you can see your new website in action for the very first time.

Use your favorite package manager to run this command and start the Hugo development server.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="npm">
```bash
npm run dev
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="pnpm">
```bash
pnpm run dev
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Yarn">
```bash
yarn run dev
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

If all goes well, Hyas should now be serving your project on [http://localhost:1313](http://localhost:1313/)!

The Hugo server will listen for live file changes in your project directory, so you will not need to restart the server as you make changes during development.

If you aren't able to open your project in the browser, go back to the terminal where you ran the `dev` command and look to see if an error occurred, or if your project is being served at a different URL than the one linked to above.

## Starter Templates

You can also start a new Hyas project based on an [official example](https://github.com/gethyas/create-hyas#templates) by passing a `--template` argument to the `create hyas` command or by using a tool like [degit](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit) to scaffold your project with the `main` branch of any GitHub repository.

### Official

Create a new project with an official example â€” for example with Doks:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="npm">
```bash
# Syntax: npm create hyas@latest -- --template <example-name>
npm create hyas@latest -- --template doks
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="pnpm">
```bash
# Syntax: pnpm create hyas@latest --template <example-name>
pnpm create hyas@latest --template doks
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Yarn">
```bash
# Syntax: yarn create hyas --template <example-name>
yarn create hyas@latest --template doks
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Community

Create a new project based on a GitHub repository's main branch

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="npm">
```bash
# Syntax: npx degit <user/repo> [project-directory]
npx degit h-enk/simply-cyan my-hyas-project
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="pnpm">
```bash
# Syntax: pnpm dlx degit <user/repo> [project-directory]
pnpm dlx degit h-enk/simply-cyan my-hyas-project
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Yarn">
```bash
# Syntax: yarn dlx degit <user/repo> [project-directory]
yarn dlx degit h-enk/simply-cyan my-hyas-project
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
