Images is the official images integration for the [Hyas](https://gethyas.com/) framework. This guide will help you get started with Images. See the [manual setup instructions](https://images.gethyas.com/docs/start-here/manual-setup/) to add Images to an existing Hyas project.

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; gap: 0.5rem;">
  <Button href="https://images.gethyas.com/">View documentation</Button>
</div>

## Quick start

To follow this guide, you'll need an existing Hyas project with Images installed.

### Check if Images is installed

Check if Images is installed by running the following command in your project's root directory:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="npm">
```bash
npm list @hyas/images
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="pnpm">
```bash
pnpm list @hyas/images --depth 1
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Yarn">
```bash
yarn list @hyas/images --depth=1
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

This will print the version of the package installed. If nothing is printed, you'll first need to add Images â€” proceed with the [manual setup instructions](https://images.gethyas.com/docs/start-here/manual-setup/).
