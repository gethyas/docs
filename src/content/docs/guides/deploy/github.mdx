You can use [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to host a Hyas website directly from a repository on [GitHub.com](https://github.com/).

## How to deploy

You can deploy a Hyas site to GitHub Pages by using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) to automatically build and deploy your site. To do this, your source code must be hosted on GitHub.
