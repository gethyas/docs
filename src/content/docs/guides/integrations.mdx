**Hyas integrations** add new functionality and behaviors for your project with only a few lines of code. You can write a custom integration yourself, use an official integration, or use integrations built by the community.

Integrations canâ€¦

- Unlock React, Vue, Svelte, Solid, and other popular UI frameworks.
- Integrate tools like Tailwind, and Partytown with a few lines of code.
- Add new features to your project, like automatic sitemap generation.
- Write custom code that hooks into the build process, dev server, and more.
