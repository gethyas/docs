**Hyas integrations** add new functionality and behaviors for your project. You can write a custom integration yourself, use an official integration, or use integrations built by the community.

Integrations canâ€¦

- Unlock Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap, and other popular CSS frameworks.
- Add new features to your project, like Images and SEO.
- Integrate themes like Doks or Bolt.

## Official Integrations

## Setting up an Integration

### Adding an Integration

Add an integration to your site by running the following command in your project's root directory:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="npm">
```bash
  # Example: add Images
  npm install @hyas/images@latest
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="pnpm">
```bash
  # Example: add Images
  pnpm add @hyas/images@latest
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Yarn">
```bash
  # Example: add Images
  yarn add @hyas/images@latest
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Configuring an Integration

You'll most likely have to update the mounts configuration, add parameters, add some CSS/JavaScript, and update the PostCSS settings.

## Upgrading an Integration

To upgrade an integration, use the appropriate command for your package manager.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="npm">
```bash
  # Example: upgrade Images
  npm install @hyas/images@latest
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="pnpm">
```bash
  # Example: upgrade Images
  pnpm add @hyas/images@latest
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Yarn">
```bash
  # Example: upgrade Images
  yarn add @hyas/images@latest
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Removing an Integration

To remove an integration, uninstall the integration from your project.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="npm">
```bash
  # Example: remove Images
  npm uninstall @hyas/images
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="pnpm">
```bash
  # Example: remove Images
  pnpm uninstall @hyas/images
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Yarn">
```bash
  # Example: remove Images
  yarn remove @hyas/images
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Optionally, remove the configuration settings.

## Finding More Integrations

You can find integrations developed by the community in the [Hyas Integrations Directory](https://gethyas.com/integrations/). Follow links there for detailed usage and configuration instructions.

## Building Your Own Integration

Hyas' Integrations are inspired by npm and Hugo, and designed to feel familiar to anyone who has written an npm package or Hugo Module before.

Check out the [Build a Hyas Integration](/guides/integrations/) guide to learn what integrations can do and how to write one yourself.
