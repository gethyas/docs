Hyas is a Node.js web framework (not a Hugo framework) that makes use of **Hugo** as a site generator for it's fast website build times and flexible project organization. Hyas installs Hugo locally in your project and mounts [Hyas Integrations](https://gethyas.com/integrations/) and [Hyas Themes](https://gethyas.com/themes/) into Hugo's virtual filesystem.

## Hugo as a dependency

Hyas adheres as much as possible to [The Twelve-Factor App](https://12factor.net/) methodology, and uses [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to explicitly declare and isolate [dependencies](https://12factor.net/dependencies) â€” including Hugo.

By installing Hugo locally in your project, your project users will always use the *same* Hugo version ("It also works for me!"). A local install also guarantees that you and your project users will *always* use a Hugo version that works with (is tested for) a specific version of Hyas.

:::note[How Hyas installs Hugo locally]
Hyas uses [Hugo Installer](https://github.com/dominique-mueller/hugo-installer) to install Hugo locally in your project. 
:::

## Hugo's virtual filesystem

[Hyas Integrations](https://gethyas.com/integrations/) and [Hyas Themes](https://gethyas.com/themes/) are installed as npm modules in the `node_modules` directory of your project. Hyas [mounts](https://gohugo.io/hugo-modules/configuration/#module-configuration-mounts) the relevant `node_modules` directories to one of Hugo's corresponding [component folders](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/directory-structure/#directories), so that they're available to Hugo for processing.
