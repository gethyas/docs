Hyas is an **all-in-one Hugo-npm framework** for building **fast, flexible, and easy-to-use** websites.

Why choose Hyas over another web framework? Here are five core design principles to help explain why we built Hyas, the problems that it exists to solve, and why Hyas may be the best choice for your project or team.

## Hyas is...

- [Hugo powered](#hugo-powered): Fast website build times and flexible project organization.
- [npm managed](#npm-managed): Managing dependencies should be straightforward and easy.
- [Ready for production](#ready-for-production): Your website is optimized for speed, SEO, and security.
- [Easy to use](#easy-to-use): You don't need to be an expert to build something with Hyas.
- [Fully-featured, but flexible](#fully-featured-but-flexible): A growing number of Hyas integrations to choose from.

### Hugo powered

**Hyas uses Hugo for it's fast website build times and flexible project organization.** Hyas installs Hugo locally in your project and mounts Hyas integrations and Hyas themes into Hugo's virtual filesystem.

Hugo recommends to install it's binary [globally](https://gohugo.io/installation/). However, doing so, your project users could be using *different* Hugo versions ("It does not work for me?"). Hyas installs Hugo *locally* in your project making sure your project users will always use the *same* Hugo version ("It works for me!"). The latter also means that you and your project users will always use a Hugo version that *works* with (is tested for) a specific version of Hyas.

:::note[How Hyas installs Hugo locally]
Hyas uses [Hugo Installer](https://github.com/dominique-mueller/hugo-installer) to install Hugo locally in your project. 
:::

Hyas integrations and Hyas themes (your projects' dependencies â€” including Hugo itself) are installed as npm modules in the `node_modules` directory of your project. Hyas [mounts](https://gohugo.io/hugo-modules/configuration/#module-configuration-mounts) the relevant `node_modules` directories to one of Hugo's corresponding [component folders](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/directory-structure/#directory-structure-explained), so that they're available to Hugo for processing.

### npm managed

**Hyas was designed to make managing dependencies straightforward and easy**. With Hyas you can manage all your projects' dependencies in a single declaration file with npm.

Hugo's way of managing dependencies is [Hugo Modules](https://gohugo.io/hugo-modules/use-modules/) (requiring [Go](https://go.dev/dl/)) with (experimental) [support for npm](https://gohugo.io/commands/hugo_mod_npm_pack/). However, using the latter introduces a second method (next to the former) and a second dependencies declaration file. JavaScript web frameworks use [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-nm#use-npm-to---) (or [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/motivation), or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)) which is a single method with a single dependencies declaration file. Unfortunately, Hugo's (experimental) support for npm does not play nicely with npm (e.g. scripts are not supported).

Hyas uses npm so you can manage *all* your projects' dependencies (like e.g. linters or a code formatter) in a *single* declaration file, making managing dependencies straightforward and easy.

:::note[Still want to use Hugo Modules?]
 Thats okay! Hyas works in combination with [Hugo Modules](https://gohugo.io/hugo-modules/) (but without it's npm support).
